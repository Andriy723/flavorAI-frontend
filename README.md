# Getting Started with FlavorAI

This was created as a test task.

### 3. To run it in ordinary mode, run this command:

## Interesting things that happened to me during the task:

I had a problem with dependencies. In the package.json I wrote the version 
of tailwindcss as ^3.*" and this
version is on demo. So, basically I just spend at least 30 minutes to find
this bug, 'cause all the styles didn't work. I`m so glad that I have found this bug.
